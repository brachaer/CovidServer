# Covid Manager  - Server
## Created using NodeJs, Express, JavaScript, MongoDB

The COVID Management System for Health Funds is a specialized application designed to help health insurance providers and organizations
 effectively manage the COVID-19 pandemic for their members and beneficiaries. It provides a comprehensive set of features and functionalities
 tailored to the specific needs of health funds.
designed to manage and track the health status and COVID-19-related information of members enrolled in a health insurance fund.
The system maintains a centralized database of all members, allowing easy access to their individual records.

Upon launching the System, users are presented with a list of all members registered with the health insurance fund. 
This list is populated through manual entry, ensuring accurate and up-to-date member information.

When a user selects a specific member from the list, the system opens their individual record card,
displaying a wealth of relevant data and details. The record card provides a comprehensive overview of the member's health status, 
vaccination history, and COVID-19-related information.

The client record card includes the following key details:
Personal Info and covid Details.

All Client data is securely stored and easily accessible.
